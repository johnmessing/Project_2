Understand the significance of feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning in fine-tuning your predictions.

Whether you're a cryptocurrency enthusiast, trader, or data science enthusiast, this notebook empowers you to unravel the mysteries of market dynamics and make informed decisions. Dive into the world of Python-driven machine learning and elevate your understanding of cryptocurrency price movements like never before. Welcome to the future of financial forecasting!
Data Collection: The tool will collect historical and present data for Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies, , through APIs such as yfinance. This data will serve as the foundation for analysis.

Percentile Change Comparison: The tool will calculate and compare the percentile change in the prices of these commodities over time, allowing users to identify trends and patterns.

Machine Learning: is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. 

Visualization: Matplotlib and hvplot will be used to create informative visualizations. This will include line charts  to make complex data more accessible.

Pandas Data Analysis: Pandas will be utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis to answer research questions and provide relevant insights.

API Integration: Data will be continuously updated via APIs to ensure that the tool provides real-time information for decision-making.

​
Explain how to get your project up and running on the user's local machine.
​
### Prerequisites
​​
Python (v3.6 or higher)
​
### Installation
​

​​
Necessary dependencies:
​
​npm install 
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install pathlib

​
## Usage
​
In the majority of cases, the end user of an application is not a person who has knowledge in the programming area. This is why developing an analysis tool with an easy-to-use interface is so crucial.
The objective of the commodity comparer is to make accessible financial analysis for people who are not versed in the programming area but have knowledge in the financial field.
The use of Yahoo Finance gives the application an always 'up-to-date' information data source, which serves as a future-proofs design.
